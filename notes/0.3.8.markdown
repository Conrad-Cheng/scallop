This version includes the following improvements:

* added cross-publishing for Scala 2.9.2
* fixed bug with help and version info printing
* added reading of options from stdin or from file
* fitted ScallopOption to be usable in for-comprehensions
* Removed the need to call `verify` at the end of each ScallopConf object - it now happens auto-magically
